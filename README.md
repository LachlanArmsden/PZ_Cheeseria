# Patient Zero Cheeseria

This project utilises React and ASP.NET Core to create a web page that displays 5 different cheeses.
It is also able to calculate the total price based on the weight the user inputs in.

# What Would I do if I had more time.
1. Have more error handling across the project (E.x. Total Price displays incorrectly if there is no value in weight.).
2. Incoporating styling, so that the page looks formatted properly (E.x. Table is not centered correctly.).
3. Create more Unit Tests for the React components (As they currently do not have any.)
4. Handle situations if there is no connection to the server from the client (E.x. Creating a default html file to display when there is no connection.).
5. Finish implementing the Dockerfile, as I had some problems when trying to integrate it (This file can be seen in myDockerFile).
