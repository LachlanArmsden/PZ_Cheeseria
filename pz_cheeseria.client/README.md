# Patient Zero Cheeseria

This project utilises React and ASP.NET Core to create a web page that displays 5 different cheeses.
It is also able to calculate the total price based on the weight the user inputs in.

# What Would I do if I had more time.
1. I would handle error catches across the project (E.x. Total Price displays incorrectly if there is no value in weight.).
2. I would define the styles to be used, so that the page looks formatted properly (E.x. Table is not centered correctly.).
3. I would create more Unit Tests for the React components (As they currently do not have any.)
4. I would handle situations if there is no connection to the server from the client (E.x. Creating a default html file to display when there is no connection.).
