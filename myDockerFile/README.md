# Dockerfile
I have attempted to create a Dockerfile but unfortunately I was unable to get it to work due to my inexperience with working with Dockerfiles. 
The problem that occured was the data was not fetching correctly, meaning that the data in the back-end could not reach the front-end, leading the table to be blank.
I have uploaded what I have completed regarding the Dockerfile within this folder, but it does not run with the project.
